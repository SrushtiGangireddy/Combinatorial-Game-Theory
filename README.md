# Combinatorial-Game-Theory


When there is a game in which two players are moving alterantively, where both players have perfect information. The rules exist for such game for the game 
to end eventually. There are no draws and the winner of the game is determined by the player that has no move to make.

The player with no move is declared as the loser.

The theory of combinational game theory took birth from that of impartial games, where at each and every stage, the same set of moves are available to both the players.

Each turn changes the state of the game by a valid move.

At some state, when there are no valid moves, the player loses.
