/*

There would be two players playing in alternating turns.
Player one would always make t he first move and both players play optimally.
During each turn the player is to choose one tower of height x and reduce it to a tower of height y where x%y == 0.
If the current player does not have any valid move, he loses.

If the tower is of height 1 there is no positive number that evenly divides 1 and the player 1 does not have any valid move so he loses.
If the number of towers is even if player 1 choses one tower and reduces it to height 1, player 2 does the mirror image of same move and player 2 
always wins.
On the other hand if there are odd number of towers whatever the move player 1 always wins
