/*
Nimble Game is the variation of the standard nim game where in there would be some number of squares with some number of coins in each.
Each player take alternating turns to take 1 coin from one square and put it in any of the left squares.
The game goes on till all the coins are in the square 0 (Most left Square) or no player can make the valid move.

If the number of coins in the square are even, since the player can only take one coin all the moves of player 1 would be mirrored by player 2.
So we do not consider the squares with even number of coins for determining the winner of this game.

If the number of coins in the square is not even, we xor the square number of that square.

If the xor finally is 0 then player 2 wins else player 1.
